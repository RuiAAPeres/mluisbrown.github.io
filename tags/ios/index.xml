      <description>&lt;p&gt;The details of this case have been broken down and explained extremely well by &lt;a href=&#34;https://stratechery.com/2016/apple-the-fbi-and-security/&#34;&gt;Ben Thompson&lt;/a&gt;. The more technical details have also been very thoroughly covered by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zdziarski.com/blog/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Zdziarski&lt;/a&gt; on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am clearly on Apple&amp;rsquo;s side in this battle, and very much hope that they don&amp;rsquo;t lose. However, it&amp;rsquo;s worth pointing out that if they were to lose, that is, if they were compelled to provide a mechanism to facilitate brute force pass code cracking it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a total disaster. All anyone would need to do to keep their iPhone secure would be use a longer numeric passcode or, even better, an alpha numeric passcode. A 10 digit passcode would take several years to brute force, rather than several hours for a 6 digit one. A 10 character alpha numeric passcode would take thousands of years to crack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, any clued up user (criminal or otherwise) who wants to keep their iPhone secure against GovtOS just needs to use a longer passcode to make it impossible to crack in a useful time period. With Touch ID, the inconvenience of a long passcode is hugely reduced, so I would strongly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
